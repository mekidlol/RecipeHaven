Problem Statement

Cooking enthusiasts often struggle to organize and access their favorite recipes efficiently. Traditional cookbooks or scattered digital notes make it difficult to search for recipes based on ingredients, cuisine, or dietary preferences. There is a need for a user-friendly, interactive recipe book application that allows users to store, search, and filter recipes easily through an intuitive graphical interface.

To enable users to save recipes locally in an organized format for easy access.

To create a simple and visually appealing interface for smooth user interaction.

To improve usability and accessibility compared to traditional text-based recipe storage methods.
